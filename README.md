## Schreier's Algorithm

This repository contains an implementation of the [Schreier Sims Algorithm](https://mathstrek.blog/2018/06/12/schreier-sims-algorithm/) in Kotlin.

The algorithm uses the fact that for a group $G$ generated by a set of generators $A\subset S_n$, that is $G = \langle A \rangle$ and an element $k \in \{1,\dots,n\}$, if we consider the orbit $O_k$ under $G$ and $G_k := \{g \in G | g*k = k\}$ the stabilizer of k, we have that
$$|O_k| = \frac{|G|}{|G_k|}.$$
Implying that we can compute the size of the group recursively
$$|G| = \prod_{k=1}^{n}|G_k|.$$
