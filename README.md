# Schreier-Sims Algorithm Implementation

A Kotlin implementation of the [Schreier-Sims Algorithm](https://mathstrek.blog/2018/06/12/schreier-sims-algorithm/) for computing permutation group sizes and solving Rubik's cube configurations.

## Overview

This project implements the Schreier-Sims algorithm, which efficiently computes the size of permutation groups using the orbit-stabilizer theorem. The algorithm leverages the mathematical relationship:

$$|O_{x}| = \frac{|G|}{|G_x|}$$

where $O_x$ is the orbit of element $x$ under a group $G$, and $G_x$ is the stabilizer of $x$. This allows recursive computation of group sizes:

$$|G| = \prod_{k}\left|O_{(x_k)}\right|$$

where we define $G_{(0)}:=G$ and for each $k$ recursively $O_{(x_{k+1})}$ is the orbit of element $x_{k+1}$ under the group $G_{(k)}$, and $G_{(x_{k + 1})}$ is the stabilizer of $x_{k+1}$.

### Key Features

- **Permutation group analysis**: Compute sizes of groups generated by permutation sets
- **Rubik's cube solver**: Find optimal move sequences for cube configurations
- **Bidirectional search**: Optimized pathfinding with multiple performance enhancements

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Java 21 or higher**
- **Gradle** (included via wrapper)

### Installation

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SchreierSimsAlgorihtm
   chmod +x gradlew
   ./gradlew build
   ```

### Usage

Run the algorithm with cube face generators and target permutation:

```bash
./gradlew run --args="<generators> <faces_to_permute> [filter_cycles]"
```

**Parameters:**
- `generators`: Comma-separated face moves (F,B,L,R,U,D)
- `faces_to_permute`: Comma-separated face numbers to manipulate
- `filter_cycles`: Optional cycle patterns to filter solutions

### Example

```bash
./gradlew run --args="F,R,U 3,16,25,5,28,8,30,35"
```

**Output:**
```
